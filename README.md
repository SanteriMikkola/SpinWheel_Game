# SpinWheel
SpinWheel is a thrilling game of luck and rewards. Players use coins to play, and winning results in earning more coins, while losing occurs if no matches are made. Additionally, players can collect coins through the Daily Reward feature, available every 12 hours. Bets can be set at 100, 500, 2000, or 5000 coins. The game features immersive music and exciting win-effect sounds, with adjustable volume in the settings. I personally handled every aspect of this project, including programming, graphics, game objects, and more.
